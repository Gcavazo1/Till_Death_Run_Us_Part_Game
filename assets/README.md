# Game Assets

This directory is for storing the game assets. You'll need to add your own assets for the game to display correctly.

## Required Assets

### Images (`/images`)
- `graveyard-bg.png` - Background for the game scene
- `ground.png` - Ground/platform image
- `game-over.png` - Game over screen

### Sprites (`/sprites`)
- `zombie-bride.png` - Spritesheet for the player character with run, jump, and slide animations

### Collectibles (`/images`)
- `soul-orb.png` - Collectible item

### Obstacles (`/images`)
- `tombstone.png` - Obstacle
- `dead-tree.png` - Obstacle

You can either create these assets yourself or find suitable replacements. Just make sure to update the asset paths in the PreloadScene.ts file if you use different filenames.
